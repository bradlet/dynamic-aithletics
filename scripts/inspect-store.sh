#
# inspect-store.sh — open the app's SwiftData (SQLite) store in sqlite3.
#
# Locates the store, copies it (+ its -wal/-shm) to a temp dir so the live
# database is never touched, and opens an sqlite3 session with two convenience
# views that un-mangle the Core Data Z-names and decode the nested workout JSON:
#
#     SELECT * FROM exercises;   -- one row per Exercise (planned + completed)
#     SELECT * FROM workouts;    -- one row per *recorded* exercise, decoded
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/inspect-store.sh                 # booted simulator's installed app
#   scripts/inspect-store.sh <file.store>    # a specific store file
#   scripts/inspect-store.sh <dir|.xcappdata># search a folder for default.store
#                                            #   (e.g. a container downloaded from
#                                            #    a physical device via Xcode)
#   scripts/inspect-store.sh -q "SELECT ..." # run one query and exit
#
# Env:
#   BUNDLE_ID   app bundle id (default: bradlet.Hybrid-AIthletics)
#
# See docs/INSPECTING_DATA.md for the full walkthrough.
