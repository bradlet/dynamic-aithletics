//  Recorded-instance data for an `Exercise`. This is a plain Codable value
//  type (NOT a SwiftData @Model) stored inline on `Exercise.workout`, so an
//  exercise and its recorded performance are a single entity. The activity's
//  date lives on `Exercise.date`; this type carries only the data that exists
//  once the activity has actually been performed.
